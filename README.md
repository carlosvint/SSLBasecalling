# SSLBasecalling
Code Implementation for the paper Self-Supervised Representation Learning for Basecalling.

This implementation is built over [SACall](https://github.com/huangnengCSU/SACall-basecaller). Hence, for supervised training and finetuning it is necessary to install [ctc-decode](https://github.com/parlance/ctcdecode).
